I attended a physics class at Cal Tech taught by two professors. One was giving a lecture on the sun
when he said, ''... and the mean temperature of the inside of the sun is 13,000,000 to 25,000,000
degrees." At this point the other instructor broke in and asked, "Is that Celsius or Kelvin (absolute zero
or Celsius -273)?"
The first lecturer turned to the board for a minute and then said, "What's the difference?" The moral of
the story is that when your calculations have a possible error of 12,000,000, a difference of 273 doesn't
mean very much.
