/******************************************
 * Define a base class shape that can describe any simple shape such as a
square, circle or equilateral triangle. The size of all these shapes can be reduced to a single
dimension.
Define derived classes for each of the three shapes.
Create a virtual function in the base class that returns the area of each shape.
Note: You will need to more precisely define what dimensions are stored in the base class. (Is
the size in the base class for circle, the radius, or the diameter?)
