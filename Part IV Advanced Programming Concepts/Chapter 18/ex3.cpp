/************************************************
Write a class to implement a sparse integer array. This is much like a simple
integer array:
int simple_array[100];
But unlike a simple array, the indices can go from 0 to 1,000,000. That's the bad news. The
good news is that at most 100 elements will be set at any time. The rest of the elements will be
zero
